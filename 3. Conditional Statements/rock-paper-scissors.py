Rock Paper Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The possible outcomes are:

    Rock destroys scissors.
    Scissors cut paper.
    Paper covers rock.
    If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

computer_choice = rock/paper/scissors(random choice on program start)

user_choice = input("Enter rock, paper, or scissors: ") if user_choice is not rock, paper, or scissors, print "Invalid choice"

if
elif
elif ...


You won
You lost, the computer chose
you tied
